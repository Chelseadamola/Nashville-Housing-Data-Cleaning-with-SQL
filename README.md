# Nashville-Housing-Data-Cleaning-Project with-SQL
This project aims to clean and preprocess a housing dataset using SQL. The dataset contains information about houses, such as the Parcel ID, property address, sale date, and the sale price e.t.c. However, the data contains errors, missing values, duplicates, or inconsistencies that need to be addressed before the data can be used for analysis or modeling. In this project, we used SQL queries to explore and clean the data, and documented the steps taken and the decisions made along the way.

To perform this cleaning, we utilized several SQL functions such as substrings, parsename, cte, and others. 
Specifically, we removed duplicates to ensure that each house is represented only once in the dataset, populated missing addresses using available information, and standardized date formats to ensure consistency across the dataset and that any insights or predictions derived from the data are reliable and useful. 
In addition, we made sure to leave short notes within the query as a guide to help others understand the steps taken during the cleaning process.
